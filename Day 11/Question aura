  We have to make an object named as booking which has a lookup on account and has a field as StartDate ,EndDate and comment when the booking
  is made then other bookings shouldn't be on the days between those dates and then save should be there and first input is done then check availability
  then if booking already made on the same day then different pop up will be shown.
